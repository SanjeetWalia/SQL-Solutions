For this challenge you need to create a RECURSIVE Hierarchical query. You have a table employees of employees, you must order each employee by level. You must use a WITH statement and name it employee_levels after that has been defined you must select from it.

A Level is in correlation what manager managers the employee. e.g. an employee with a manager_id of NULL is at level 1 and then direct employees with the employee at level 1 will be level 2.

employees table schema
id
first_name
last_name
manager_id (can be NULL)
resultant schema
level
id
first_name
last_name
manager_id (can be NULL)
NOTE: refer to the Results: expected table if you're stuck with how it should be displayed.


-- Create your SELECT statement here
WITH RECURSIVE employee_levels as (
select 
  1 as level, 
  id, 
  first_name, 
  last_name, 
  manager_id
  from employees 
  where manager_id is NULL
  union all 
  select 
  l.level+1 as level, 
  e.id, 
  e.first_name, 
  e.last_name,
  e.manager_id
  from employees e inner join employee_levels l on e.manager_id = l.id
)


SELECT 
*
from employee_levels
